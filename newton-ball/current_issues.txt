the ballcon script correctly moves the ball based on force applyed and considers the mass.
still need to make it take information for the foces as a buttion instead of a text box.(should be fairly simple)
still need to make the force change when it interacts with the next ball or the end swing collider.

the if statement for starting the movement based on a bool from the start buttion does work but the controllers don't set the bool to true after collision.

still need to create an actual cradle (currently just orbs and cubes for testing the scripts).
