the ballcon script correctly moves the ball based on force applyed and considers the mass.
still need to make it take information for the forces as a buttion instead of a text box.(should be fairly simple). will set public variables in a empty gameobject with a script and heve the nessecary other scripts access them
need to stop the last ball from falling to the ground and rolling if the forces decrease to much. (may actually be funny if we handly it right and make a string/wire "break" and play it off as a "technical difficulty")
may need to adjust the rate the forces decrease between ends.

the collision statement for changeing the bool for the start buttion doesn't seem to work with the "hands" setting the bool to true in editor does work as intended.
need to create code to alter other 

still need to create an actual cradle (currently just orbs and cubes for testing the scripts).
will look into if hindge joint(POSSABLY viable)
