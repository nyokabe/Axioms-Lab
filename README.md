What Is Axiom's Lab?

Axiom’s Lab, Shot in the Dark is a VR prototype game in which users will explore the dynamics of physics and learn how different 
properties of physics changes the outcome of bouncing balls. The user will be guided by a mad scientist named Axiom who will test 
the user’s capability to solve his absurd but witty puzzles. The user “volunteers” to step onto the stage as the mad Axiom hides 
behind his microphone, in which he hopes that the new volunteer will give him a lively show.

Professor Axiom is an adorable mouse that is teaching both children and adults diferent aspects of physics in a fun and unique way.
